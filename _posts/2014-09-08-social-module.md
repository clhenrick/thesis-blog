## Description
This project is a first attempt at examining how cities are spatially represented based on data from social media. Urban areas are color coded as to whether or not they have Flickr users. This is based on data from Flickr's [Alpha Shapes](http://code.flickr.net/2011/01/08/flickr-shapefiles-public-dataset-2-0/) and Natural Earth Data's [Urban Areas](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-urban-area/). Ten minutes of geotagged "tweets" I mined from Twitter are over layed in their temporal sequence. My goal here is to begin looking at how data mined from social media can be used in the mapping process. One of my classmates gave me the idea of mapping the places in the world that aren't represented in social media, which I believe is what I was starting to get at with this prototype, but could be pushed further.
