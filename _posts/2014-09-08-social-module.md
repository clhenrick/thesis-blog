## Description
This project is a first attempt at examining how cities are spatially represented based on data from social media. Urban areas are color coded as to whether or not they have Flickr users or not. (Based on data from Flickr's [Alpha Shapes](http://code.flickr.net/2011/01/08/flickr-shapefiles-public-dataset-2-0/) and Natural Earth [Urban Areas](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-urban-area/)). 10 minutes of geotagged "tweets" from Twitter are over layed in their temporal sequence.
