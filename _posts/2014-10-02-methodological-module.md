## Prototype
For this module I began to think about how to streamline the user experience of adding media to a map, or adding a spatial component to media. As a starting point I began to paper prototype an app:
![]({{site.url}}/assets/method-present/img/paper-prototype01.gif)

----------

This helped me to start thinking about refinements to the UI:

The user should be able to import geotagged photos in one of 3 methods:  

1. drag and dropping photos that are already geotagged.
2. batch uploading multiple photos at a time that are already geotagged.
3. manually setting the location.

In steps one and two software will be able to extract a photo's latitude and longitude coordinates from the meta data.

The last step could be done in one of two ways:  

- enter the name of place (country, state/province, city, neighborhood).
- interact with a web-map interface to add and place a marker.

This step could be done for single or multiple photos. More paper prototyping and user testing will help determine how to make this process more intuitive.
