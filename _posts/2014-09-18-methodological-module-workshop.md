Today we had a workshop for the Methodological Module where we focused on the process our stakeholders typically work through in order to solve a problem or accomplish a goal. For my domain I decided to outline the process of cartographic design from both cartographers and counter-mappers. I found it useful to compare and contrast each of these to see where I can add to or augment the process of counter-mapping.

The following is a table describing the processes of mapping from a traditional expert cartographer and a counter-mapper:

## Next Steps:

Deciding where to intervene in the counter-mapping process is what comes next. One thought to propose is intervening in the design process and creating a tool to make it easier for counter-mappers to embed media into their maps such as images, sound and video. For example a web-interface that has a drag and drop capability would make it easy for the user to augment points on their map with additional media. As a methodological prototype I am proposing to wire frame / mock up an interface for such a tool. With time permitting this tool could be constructed.
