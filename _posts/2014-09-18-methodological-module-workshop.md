Today we had a workshop for the Methodological Module where we focused on the process our stakeholders typically work through in order to solve a problem or accomplish a goal. For my domain I decided to outline the process of cartographic design from both cartographers and counter-mappers. I found it useful to compare and contrast each of these to see where I can add to or augment the process of counter-mapping.

The following is a table describing the processes of mapping from a traditional expert cartographer and a counter-mapper:

| Step                   | Cartographer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Counter Mapper                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planing Stage          | Determine the Objective and who the audience is. Usually this is determined by a RFP or Design Brief.                                                                                                                                                                  | Decide what is "mappable." The audience is likely the general public / non-experts                                                                                                          |
| Medium                 | Will the map be printed, online, interactive, part of an application?                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Will the map be published in a book, online article, part of an organization's website, gallery or museum, as street art, etc.                                                              |
| Methods                | Choose what technology will be implemented: proprietary or open-source GIS and cartographic software, or a combination of them.                                                                                                                                        | Choose what technology will be implemented: proprietary or open-source software, GIS, illustrator, hand-drawn techniques or a combination of them.                                          |
| Layers                 | Establish what features will be represented and their order on the map as layers.                                                                                                                                                                                      | What are the non-normative feature(s) the map will represent?                                                                                                                               |
| Data                   | Source data for each of the features from government agencies, open street map, or create custom data (eg: digitizing paper maps). Process and analyze data as needed.                                                                                                 | Do research to acquire data as it's probably not easy to find. Could be primary research, qualitative research, participatory mapping or digging through city records in analog format.     |
| Design                 | Begin Constructing map from data (following typical cartographic conventions and aesthetics: precision of data, generalization of data, choice of features to include, use of color for emphasizing important part(s), using typographic hierarchy in labeling, etc.)  | Deciding how to make the map design non-normative (could be a use of one or more of the following: aesthetics, form of map (eg: a non-euclidean map), functionality, experimentation, etc.) |
| Interaction (optional) | If interactive, determine interactivity and functionality (is it an App or just a map with pop-ups and mouseover events?)                                                                                                                                              | If interactive, determine interactivity and functionality (is it an App or just a map with pop-ups and mouseover events?)                                                                   |
| Critique               | Print Out & Critique the map (if it’s not just a typical GIS department and the experts have cartographic design skill) AND/OR user test an interactive version (the latter doesn’t always happen).                                                                    | Augmentation of the map, could be through writing, art-work, including other media such as video, sound, photography, etc                                                                   |
| Iterate                | Iterate (refine: data, aesthetic, interactivity)                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Iterate (refine: data, aesthetic, interactivity)                                                                                                                                            |
| Publish                | Printed or digital version, is it confidential or open to the public, or for internal purposes (such as City Planning).                                                                                                                                                | Releasing the map to the public: (this could be an article online or in a magazine or zine, printed in a book, displayed in an art gallery or museum)                                       |

## Next Steps:

Deciding where to intervene in the counter-mapping process is what comes next. One thought to propose is intervening in the design process and creating a tool to make it easier for counter-mappers to embed media into their maps such as images, sound and video. For example a web-interface that has a drag and drop capability would make it easy for the user to augment points on their map with additional media. As a methodological prototype I am proposing to wire frame / mock up an interface for such a tool. With time permitting this tool could be constructed.
