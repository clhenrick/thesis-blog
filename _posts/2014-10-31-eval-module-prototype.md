I refined the prototype for the NYC Property Extractor web app a bit more with some minor UI / UX changes. The app now only lets the user select an area when they are zoomed into the neighborhood scale (greater than or equal to zoom 16). This limits the amount of data a user may select so that they won't say be able to select all of Brooklyn and bog down the server or database. Other changes include panning and zooming the map to the area the user selects when they draw a shape or click on a tax lot.
