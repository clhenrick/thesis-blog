I've put some more work into the site and it can now be viewed live at [amirentstabilized.com](http://amirentstabilized.com). I've adjusted the layout to be responsive so that it will load on mobile devices and various screen sizes. 

## User Testing

My colleague Crystal Tong user tested the website and gave me some good feedback:

*I love the wording. It was really friendly, and approachable and kept my curiosity going.*

*I like the singular flow of the page. And the payoff of reading and going through everything was great.*

*It kept me curious because I found out my building is rent stabilized. Which led me to ask a lot of questions, like I know certain laws allow apartments to be rent stabilized because that tenant has been there for years, and if they move out and the landlord remodels, then he/she is allowed to increase the price. and if it's above $2500, then it's considered a luxury building, so I wonder if that law applies to me.*

*So while this is a great great prototype, to push this further, I think I'm looking for more payoff, such as getting my questions answered, and bringing me to a FAQ page. and if it's difficult to get my questions answered, could you direct me to some NGO's that handle landlord, tenant rights issues based on my neighborhood?*

*Some misc feedback:* 

*Can I see a timeline of how long this process is? a timeline on the right hand side of where I am in this process.*

*First have them check here too!*   
- *I expected a sharing capability.* 

1. *Can I have an example of an email of what I should say? like a template?*

2. *Can you open the governments form in a separate tab please*
