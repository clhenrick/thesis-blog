Working with a partner we did a "workout" or brainstorming session for the social module assignment. [Gabrielle Patacsil](www.linkedin.com/pub/gabrielle-patacsil/8/275/135) and I worked together on this. The following is what I gathered for my thesis domains:

## 1. Domain Stretching
*Present your general idea or area of interest/inquiry to your partner. Stretch the idea to fit in as many domains as possible. Map these domains out on the walls or on paper.*

__Domains Related to Counter Mapping and Critical Cartography:__

- GIS
- Cartography
- Social Justice
- social media
- critical theory
- influence of & access to technology
- local government
- humanitarian aid (HOT)
- mobile / location based services
- Civic Engagement
- Researchers
- Policy Analysts
- Urban Planners
- Activists
- Environmentalists
- Academics
- Urbanists & Civic Hackers
- Non-profits

## 2. Hit the Large Groups
*Identify the core communities and groups that form these groups. Identify actual groups (websites, conferences, institutions, people) and create a simple Venn diagram that expresses the relevance of these communities to one another. Then compile a “core list” of priority contacts who you plan to contact and locate these people within your diagram.*

## 3. Work the Core
__Make a prototype__

*Plan a prototype that will be executed in the next week, which helps to exemplify or examine the social module. Be sure to include some discussion of how you will document the prototype and/or it’s development. This need not be a comprehensive examination. It can be a very small intervention or experiment that exhibits some of the qualities that you think are important with regard to some of the social aspects of your work. For example: an intervention that exhibits the values and challenges associated with persuasive design. (It could be a documentation of failure too!)*
