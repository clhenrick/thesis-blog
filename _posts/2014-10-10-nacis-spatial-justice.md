**Notes on the Spatial Justice Workshop @ NACIS 2014**

## Spatial Justice: What is it?
- power relationships
- spatial relationships of inequality: food deserts, poverty, pollution, transit
- costs accumulate over time
- inequitable justice from political districts that are representative of only one type of groups
- more voices on the map
- how maps present “evidence” or a counter-narrative
- ensuring the equitable use of and self determination of space: social, political; connected to grass roots
- climate change, environmental justice, indigenous rights
- geography, but also spatial configurations perpetuate inequalities, negative feedback loop; cartographers can intervene

## Community: What is it?
- exclusion
- inclusion
- common interests
- like minded
- connections
- common goal, working towards
- only geographic, online communities are networks
- level of organization, representation, ability to speak as a unit
- dynamic, fragmented
- community vs. neighborhood; do they mean the same thing? share same values?

## Presentations

### When does a map matter? or sometimes maps are nice
Tim Stallman

- north chapel hill, roberts road neighborhood
- landfill located placed in area during 70’s
- no sewer service, fight env justice, fighting for 30 years
- 3 months of mapping, door to door survey
- tim’s learning about skills and limitations as a cartographer:
  - speaking with people
  - open ended questions about race and ethnicity identities
  - good data takes time
- map won’t fix the problem, community knows about problems
- responding to racism and paternalism
- made a topo map better that what the planners had, made them listen

### Saving Open Space in CA

John Cloud  
NOAA Central Library

- 3d model of ranch to preserve from development
- saved ranch, became sedgwick preserve
- bringing humanism to maps
- two communities: plants / fauna, and humans that defended it
- walked all trails that were mapped

### Stanford Spatial History Project: Rebooting History
Jake (?)

- worked with Michael Levin, a "spatial documentarian"; incorporating ideas of space and narrative
- East Palo Alto, CA (area btwn facebook and google)
- during WW2 ship building one of few places african americans could buy property
- lack of cohesion within community, large land owners resisted incorporation efforts
- area lacked leverage to resist highway 101 building
- impacts of highway construction bisected community
  - students had to be bused because their high school was closed
  - spend at least an extra hour getting to school than their peers

### GIS Workshop course
Matthew of Kentucky Univ.

- (see video)
- working with community partners
- help community organizations in Lexington to map needs
- maps showing impacts of environmental hazards, etc.
- emphasize process over product; focus on issues in the neighborhoods and use maps as a vehicle

## Breakout Group Questions:

### How/when/why can maps grow community power? When do they get in the way?
- based on context of the situation & community needs

*When Maps Get in the Way:*

- if the community already knows the issue and doesn’t need it mapped
- if the issue changes and is more complex it can get in the away
- if the map hasn’t evolved
- people can think maps as truth
- maps can often bludgeon a pluralistic issue, can contain a singular voice, problematic for a community organization representing mulitple voices

*Static maps vs. interactive?*

- power of interactive decision making is in the parameters of interactivity
- participatory gis scholars struggle with this ^ assuming community partners were knowledgable in this
- do people have control in creating the interface
- people being empowered is essential
- interactive can become a barrier to someone who isn’t tech savy; UI burdened with heaps of data; needs to be purposeful for issues of community; in need of curation of community
- medium dependent on audience; print for people who aren’t tech savy

- maps have immediate power: in Lexington; graphic that binds group together; can be positive to concretize an activity; allow a collective to see themselves through a graphic
- asking community groups what they need: website, social media campaign
- map is only one piece of a larger puzzle: supplying non-profits with access to technology
- finding a balance to technology with timing
- let partners that it’s a sustainable opportunity, re-occuring
- using PAR in the project
- having questions formed in the community
- students as technological facilitators allowing the questions to be guided by the community orgs

### How can projects grow community or constituency capacity?
- non-profits not having time to see what other are working on

### How do you balance between building capacity and efficiency gains of just doing the work yourself?


*Lize Mogel:*

- DGIE to empower black residents to use power of mapping to address racial injustice
- Where commuter run over black children on the pointes-downtown track
- serious effects of unequal transportation planning
- data collection helping political people get fatality data and community input
- policy change is unlcear but powerful

*Wikimapa example:*

- Rio de Janeiro slums
- city asked Google to replace favela with word for hill before world cup
- community based mapping with kids using GPS & cellphones: mapping streets and informal shops
- ethical delemma: sell it to fund project or keep it in community
- goolge and microsoft expose (map) the favelas themselves (Wall Street Journal article)

## More Presentations

### Google Maps Counter Cartography during the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics
Alan McConchie  
“Detour Guide”  

- background: Vancouver trying to clean up the city before the olympics: ahistorical, cleanliness, nature, friendly first nations
- counter mapping using google my maps and osm tiles
- crowd sourced with local groups
- mapping POI’s of political and historical significance
- used google my maps so that the detour guide would show up as a guide for tourists through “google bombing” (ie: miserable failure & george bush)
- hybrid process that existed in physical space as well: held events : mapiing parties, tabling, handwritten submissions: variety of input, not just digital
- edit contributions for style and formatting but not content
- 3-4 people did most of editing by having people to tell them what to add

### Coal Ash
Jovian Sackett    
southern env law center in NC    

- coal ash is what is left over and not burned, collected and stored; contains heavy metals and radioactive materials that can seep through mis-management
- pollution of public waters and fisheries: subsistence fisherman tend to be disproportionately poor and of color
- mapping coal power plants relationship to drinking water supplies
- building databases that haven’t existed 
- incidents of residents with cancer and locations of coal power plants

## More Questions

### What is the value of representing community / spatial justice issues? Representation for whom? By whom?

- maps can reveal things ways that other forms can’t; ie spatial relationships that can’t be seen on spread sheets
- authoritativeness to maps that make them paid attention to
- granting access gives you a sense of why this is important
- honoring a community’s contribution
- columbia (country) people who were self taught; did not want to give up their data
- insider / outsider: access for data transmission
- how can we work with people so that we don’t have duplication of efforts?
- a lot of communities can make their own maps
- not so much bringing tools but facilitating where information access and data can flow
- people without education can use maps very well, most people can think spatially
- some communities communicate that youre the map expert so that’s your role as an outsider
- not necessarily a bad thing, but there are issues related to representation

__*the participants involved in research haven’t been historically listened to / acknowledged; so is it then my job to translate their language into one that white planners can understand?*__

- what’s the longer term view / goal to shift the dynamic so that people have a voice?
- community asking; “we need a policy document that can benefit us”, not just a research paper
- discrimination is a huge problem; acknowledge their knowledge even if it isn’t “official”

- where does this data reside? how is it being used? who owns it? how does it circulate?
- open data movement: what is the end goal? eg: mapping vacant parcels in New Orleans;
- needs a critical lens: communities need a reason for making their data open.
- data can be used for a host of endeavors, not just one’s presence or resources. They can be extracted after being codified.


### What questions around race/class & insider/outsider come up in this work, and how do you navigate these from your subject position?

...

### What were some of the main points? What was new to you? Lessons Learned? Disagreed with?
- tool used to build capacity vs. data resources; what about when people are self taught and know the tools?
- does open data always positively impact a community? Or should they retain ownership?
- map data being powerful, should it be open or not?

### Is there a value of communities mapping themselves?
- longevity in the project is important
- higher education avoiding the “research safari” sending students to extract knowledge vs. creating a sustained relationship, not determined by the academic term.
- hybrid approach: foil requests and tech skills with personal narratives to balance out and bring additional context that isn’t top down
- people don’t have to use any technology, there are other ways to contribute to decision making
- empowering people doesn’t mean having to teach technology, could just be leadership

### Difference between you as the expert vs. the person you’re mapping for / on / with? How to bridge the gap between you and participant / subject.
- should be a qualitative measure
- in building a schedule it always takes more time for qualitative measurements to close the gap
- gap is difficult in thinking about it: community helps decide the scope of the project and the outputs, rethink the idea of the expert, not just a service provider or on a research safari, not the only decider. 
- as a mapper you have the power to shape information; bringing the community into it in much more of a sustained way
- everyone has something to contribute, knowledge to share

- role as providing linkages between government; eg: creating first database of mining companies in Ecuador; letting community define your role: you have access, can you please get that for us? working within reality as long as you remain critical

### thinking about process
- best practice is developing a propmpt that works for people rather than asking people to jump into something unfamiliar
