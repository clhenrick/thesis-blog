summary:    Reflecting on previous modules for a final prototype.
categories: conceptual-module workshops

*The goal of the conceptual module is to develop a clear explanation for how you expect others to understand the work you are doing.*

- *How does this conceptual module change for each of the stakeholders addressed in the evaluative module?*

- *Given what you consider successful in your thesis, what is the overall concept that will drive this success?*

- *also an opportunity to reflect on the prior four modules*

- *and to organize the information developed in the prior four modules*

## Part I

1. Spend a few moments reviewing your approach to the four prior modules.

For each module:

- What could you revisit?
- What information was missing?
- What information was too detailed?

2. Spend a few moments reviewing the prototypes you made for each module.

- What prototypes should you revisit?
- Given the current state of your thesis, how might the modules influence a new prototype?

3. Discuss the ways in which your understanding of the modules have changed over time how can they be effectively used to organize your proposals

## Part II

1. Discuss your final prototype for the term

- How can you integrate the considerations of your prior module work into a new prototype.
- What goals might be derived from this new prototype? What do you want to learn from a prototype about the conceptual aspects of your work?

2. Develop a set of “priority points” that must fit within your final thesis proposal.

- What issues must be included in your final thesis proposal?

3. Where does “Design” and “Technology” fit into your thesis concept?

## Part III
Plan a final prototype

- Plan a prototype that helps to exemplify or examine the conceptual module. Be sure to include some discussion of how you will document the prototype and/or it’s development.

- This SHOULD be a comprehensive examination. It can be a small intervention or experiment but should integrate the important issues discovered in the prior 4 modules to reveal the conceptual basis for your work and the project you would like to do in the coming Spring term.

- You should plan to deploy, test, and iterate this prototype at least one time before presenting it.
