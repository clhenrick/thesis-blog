Methodological Model Presentation Notes
=======================================

- 5 minutes
- main points

- thinking about how to make the field of Cartography more democratic & humanistic
- rather than mapping quantitative data began to think about mapping media
- reiterated on previous idea: an idea for an app that makes it easy for people to collaboratively map media (photos, sound, video) from previous sources
- looked at other mapping platforms for UI / UX precedence (Google, MapBox, CartoDB, OSM, etc.) these are generic / defaults
- began paper prototyping based on a generic web-map UI to see what could be improved upon
- problem: 
  - generic UI design / UX interaction for showing media on maps isn’t done well (ie: showing images and videos inside popups or linking them to a side bar)
  - process of making a map with media from varying sources isn’t easy to do, let alone collaboratively

TO DO:
- need to define user persona and niche (activists, community mapping, participatory GIS)
- examining patterns of geolocating media (instagram, flickr, etc.)
- develop paper prototype and user test
