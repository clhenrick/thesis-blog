presentation notes:


Intro

  1. Displacement is nothing new
    - 1910 photo in the LES
    - Kreuzberg, Berlin protest over increasing rents

  2. However, recently global socio-economic forces have lead to a rapid rise in displacement

  - global financial capital investment in the housing market 
     means increased real estate speculation & luxury development

  - economic downturn / recession
  - stagnating wages
  - not enough increase in job growth

  3. Charts / Photos

  - % of cities property by Daniel Hartley, a research economist at the Cleveland Federal Reserve
    
    “Census Tract) that moved from "the bottom half of the distribution of home prices in 
	the metropolitan area to the top half between 2000 and 200” 

  - implications for NYC?
     - 1/3 of the city rezoned
     - example of williamsburg from 2003 to 2013
     - evictions result in homelessness.

  4. Much of the conversation on Gentrification is around neighborhood change and improvements, not displacement
  
  - NPR recently ran a series on Gentrification in Marketplace, mostly focused on neighborhood class and business changes

  5. Research Question: What is the experience of those being displaced? How can this change the discussion on gentrification?

  6. interviewed 4 participants all who lived in Bushwick, refer to them as A, B, C and D:
  - A : woman, single mother in her mid-thirties who works for NYC dept of public health
  - B : young man who was displaced from his loft. 
  - C : woman, single mother in her early thirties who experienced several instances of landlord harassment and illegal eviction.
  - D : young man in his mid twenties who’s mother was evicted twice, first time when he was living with her.

Themes

  1. Psychological, Emotional and Physical Trauma
    - when young man went with Mother to ask for a letter from old landlord
    - when woman was dealing with land lord harassment and trying to find new housing

  2.  Lack of Stability due to Unavailability of Affordable Apartments in the Market
    - A professional single mother priced out b/c of need for adequate space
    - C saying her move cost her $5,000 and took almost a year to find a new place
    - D family was living in a shelter for a year from the first time

  3. Landlord Harassment
    - C talking about her former landlord trying to get her to move out
    - C also mentioned a suspicious burglary, as well as being harassed by phone
    - D’s mother experiencing frequent sexual harassment from former landlords

  4. Lack of accountability of landlords engaging in illegal practices
    - D’s mother’s former landlord purposefully failing a section 8 inspection 
    - C’s landlord not renewing her lease and asking for a rent increase of $1,000
    - B’s building getting a dept of building inspector called on them after years of no problem

  5. Tenants’ lack of resources to fight back
   - C gave into a crappy settlement in housing court with her old landlord
   - C didn’t call the police during the illegal eviction, because she hadn’t paid a parking ticket 


Reflection

  - difficult to gain access to individuals, future more outreach and volunteer work could help
  - probably many non-native english speakers, immigrants, others not aware of their rights
  
  - empathized with individuals, some of the stories were both infuriating and heart breaking
  - difficult to believe some times that people do these things to other people

  - felt guilty about never having had such difficulties with housing and hearing these stories

  - feel worried that I won’t be able to do these stories justice, but will try.


Moving Forward

  - work has informed my thesis work

  - Am I Rent Stabilized dot com

  - Northwest Bushwick Community Map

  - would like to pursue the research further
