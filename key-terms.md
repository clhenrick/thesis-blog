*Relating to my domain and area of interest:*

- **Cognative Mapping:**  
*to fill in*

- **Counter Mapping:**  
Using the mapping process "to contest dominant power structures [in order to] further seemingly progressive goals [[1][1]]" This process was originally used in developing countries to promote land rights and resource uses of indigenous peoples but has recently been used in developed countries for practices such as mapping community assets in urban areas.  Counter maps are typically used to adovocate policy change in a "bottom up" manner or to "make the invisible visible." An example of the latter would be a map of the oil infrastructure, corporate leasing of water rights and oil spills in the Gulf Coast; features which are not mapped on normative maps. 

- **Critical Cartography:**  
Refers to new mapping practices that use cartography's subjectivity and bias in an explicit fashion to create maps that are non-normative. This is of importace in relationship to Cartography's history which has been rooted in professionalism, science and academia where maps typically were not explicit about the map maker's intentionality but rather hidden under the "mask" of objectivity, science and accuracy [[2][2]]. CC is grounded in critical theory in the sense that the techniques used link geographic knowledge to power and political issues [[3][3]]. 

- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):**  
Refers to both software and an area of study (often distinguished from the software as Geographic Information *Science*) that specializes in inspecting, visualizing and analyzing geospatial data. GIS software is often used to model and problem solve real world environmental scenarios in fields such as urban planning, environmental science and market research. More recently GIS has migrated to the web where users can interact with geospatial data through web-based portals such as those offered by both government (Federal, State and Local) and commercial (Google Maps) platforms.

- **Interactive Data-Visualization:**

- **Geographic Literacy:**

- **Geospatial Data:**  
*to fill in*

- **The OpenStreetMap Project (OSM):**  
A mapping platform that allows for the contribution of geospatial data from anyone anywhere in the world. OSM can be thought of the "Wikipedia" version of Google Maps with the exception that all of its data is modifiable and downloadable by anyone for free [[4][4]].

- **Para-Empiricism:**  
A term coined by Annette Kim of MIT's Sidewalk Laboratory (SLAB) [[5][5]] which states that no data is free from bias, subjectivity or human influence. Thus data should never be viewed as objective.

- **Participatory Mapping:**  
Mapping processes that involve non-experts and/or community members in the mapping process using either analog or digital methods. Also refered to as *Public Participation Geographic Information Systems.*
