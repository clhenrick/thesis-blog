*Relating to my domain and area of interest:*

- **Cognative Mapping:**  
A participatory and qualitative research method where by subjects are asked to visually create a map of their environment. This typically includes places of importants, routes traveled and may include both localities and foriegn places in the same map, not drawn to scale.

- **Counter Mapping:**  
Using the mapping process "to contest dominant power structures [in order to] further seemingly progressive goals [[1][1]]" This process was originally used in developing countries to promote land rights and resource uses of indigenous peoples but has recently been used in developed countries for practices such as mapping community assets in urban areas.  Counter maps are typically used to adovocate policy change in a "bottom up" manner or to "make the invisible visible." An example of the latter would be a map of the oil infrastructure, corporate leasing of water rights and oil spills in the Gulf Coast; features which are not mapped on normative maps. 

- **Critical Cartography:**  
New mapping practices that use cartography's subjectivity and bias in an explicit fashion to create maps that are non-normative. This is of importace in relationship to Cartography's history which has been rooted in professionalism, science and academia where maps typically were not explicit about the map maker's intentionality but rather hidden under the "mask" of objectivity, science and accuracy [[2][2]]. CC is grounded in critical theory in the sense that the techniques used link geographic knowledge to power and political issues [[3][3]]. 

- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):**  
Primarily software but also may refer to the area of speacilization (often distinguished from the software as Geographic Information *Science*) used for inspecting, visualizing and analyzing geospatial data. GIS software may be used to model and problem solve real world environmental scenarios in professions such as urban planning, environmental science and market research. More recently GIS software has migrated from desktop computers to the web allowing internet users to interact with geospatial data through web applications such as those offered by government organizatons (the USGS National Map and NYC Open Data Portal for example) and commercial (Google Maps) platforms.

- **Geospatial Data:**  
Data that contains a location information attribute such as latitude and longitude coordinates. Geospatial data predominantly falls within two categories: vector data stored as points, lines and polygons and raster data stored in a pixel based format such as a TIFF. Geospatial data can be rendered visually in an x,y coordinate plane as well as be inspected for its attribute information.

- **Interactive Data-Visualization:**  
A method of descriptive stastics that allows for viewers to visually inspect different aspects of multidimensional datasets. Interaction in data visualization has been made increasingly popular in the past decade through advancements in web technology such as browsers and programming libraries such as D3 JS. A significant portion of this field overlaps with digital cartography where thematic maps are made to be dynamic and/or interactive.

- **The OpenStreetMap Project (OSM):**  
A mapping platform that allows for the contribution of geospatial data from anyone anywhere in the world. OSM can be thought of the "Wikipedia" version of Google Maps with the exception that all of its data is modifiable and downloadable by anyone for free [[4][4]].

- **Para-Empiricism:**  
A term coined by Annette Kim of MIT's Sidewalk Laboratory (SLAB) [[5][5]] which states that no data is free from bias, subjectivity or human influence. Thus data should never be viewed as completely objective or empirical.

- **Participatory Mapping:**  
Mapping processes that involve non-experts and/or community members contributing to the mapping process using either analog (ex: [Field Papers](http://fieldpapers.org/)) or digital (mobile, GPS) techniques. Also may be refered to as *Public Participation Geographic Information Systems.*
